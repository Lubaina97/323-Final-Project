My **final project for ECON 323 at UBC** - A take on the interlinking of gentrification and AirBnb in New York through 2014 and 2017! 

This was my first introduction to the world of coding and I took inspiration from a paper that did something similar, helping me understand how to express my ideas through the coding language, along with the tools from class! :)

The paper: https://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-07192019-110344/unrestricted/07242019_Dknorr_Thesis_Final2.pdf
